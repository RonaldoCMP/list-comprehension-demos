list-comprehension-demos
========================

This repository contains some demos made possible by the addition of list comprehension to OpenSCAD.
In particular it contains a user-space sweep() module which can be used to sweep a 2D shape along a 3D path.

To use these demos, first install the scad-utils library (https://github.com/openscad/scad-utils) in OpenSCAD's library path.
